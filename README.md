# Flutter Week 👨🏻‍💻🔥

## Abstract

I usually work better if I have a deadline or a goal to archive, so in order to learn new things and technologies I decided to start my personal Flutter Week 👨🏻‍💻🔥
Now, 17 august 2022 I have seen several Flutter based apps and I am aware that is one of the top skills to master in mobile/apps world.
Today I know just that the base concept will be to use some things called 'widgets' but never used them before or ever wrote a single line of Dart Language.

Starting tomorrow morting (reading 📖 and training 🏋🏻‍♂️ today 😎) 18 aug 2022 let's see in a week (25 aug 2022) how good can I learn things and what will be the best app that I will be able to create.
(Probabily I will be stuck in HelloWorld things lol)
Anyway won't be ofc a 'flex' or something like I just want have finished so early my exams so I need to work on things and acquire new skills.
Let's see 👀
