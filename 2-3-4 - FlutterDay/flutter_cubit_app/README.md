# Flutter Week Day 2 - 3 - 4 🔥👨🏻‍💻

 ### WordPair Generator
 Actually started this project, following this (vid)[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4DydJKVvQk] I think that this will be super usefull because rn I am building the frontend of the app understanding how this widget things works but I hope as soon as possible it will connect it to the backend and let it work properly

 # Flutter Week Day 5 🔥👨🏻‍💻
 Following the tutorial the app is finished, loved the course because gave me a general understanding of how the app itself works.
 Definitly looking forward to deepen more into this framework as I can (or I have time)
